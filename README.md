# Gap in Literature

Current literature lacks a holistic analysis of the relationship between
digital transformation and performance metrics in the cultural industry.
Most studies focus on individual aspects such as technology adoption or
economic impacts, but few provide an integrated view that includes
challenges and opportunities across the sector.

# Significance

Addressing this gap is crucial for policymakers, cultural managers, and
stakeholders to make informed decisions that foster sustainable growth
in the cultural sector. Understanding the impact of digital
transformation on performance can guide strategic investments, enhance
cultural policy frameworks, and support the development of adaptive
strategies for cultural organizations.

# Methodology Preview

This research utilizes a mixed-methods approach, integrating
quantitative analysis of performance data from cultural organizations
with qualitative case studies and expert interviews. Data will be
sourced from industry reports, financial records, and surveys, drawing
on gray literature to offer a comprehensive overview.

\*This study is designed to be exploratory. The overall data collection
and analysis process is illustrated in the following UML diagram and
explained in detail in the subsequent text.

## Data Collection Steps

**Step 1. Define and refine search keywords**

**\
**The initial phase of data collection involved defining the search
keywords for retrieving secondary data. We brainstormed an initial set
of keywords based on our primary objectives and research questions. The
search string was structured according to the guidelines provided by
Kitchenham (2007) \[17\].

To ensure comprehensive coverage of keywords related to {The Impact of
Digital Transformation on Performance and the Cultural Industry:
Challenges and Opportunities}, I will review the search string from a
systematic mapping study in Arts, Humanities, and Cultures. After
conducting several trial searches, observing the results, and refining
the search string, I developed the following final search string:

\[(Challenges) OR (Opportunities)\] AND \[(Digital Transformation) AND
((Cultural Industry)\]

We used {Digital Transformation} because this term is frequently used in
online sources to describe organizations adopting and implementing
digital technology. We recognize that some sources discussing
(Challenges) OR (Opportunities) might not explicitly use this term.
However, this risk was mitigated by the widespread recognition and usage
of (Challenges OR Opportunities) in digital communities alongside
{Digital Transformation} AND (Cultural Industry)\].

**Step 2: Applying search keywords using the Google search engine:**

**\
**To search online sources, the Google search engine was accessed
through the Chrome browser. To minimize the influence of geographical
location on the search results, [www.google.com](http://www.google.com)
was used. Prior to starting the search, I deleted the search history in
Chrome, cleared the browser cache, logged out of my personal Google
account, and removed all Chrome extensions. These steps were taken to
ensure that my personal and historical data had minimal impact on the
search results. In the Google search settings, I turned off Google
Instant predictions and enabled 100 results per page.

**Step 3: Export Search Results**

To facilitate analysis by multiple researchers at the University of
Leeds, the search results need to be exported. I will export the search
results (in the form of URLs) from the Chrome browser on my laptop into
a Word file (DOCX format).

**Step 4:** Apply inclusion/exclusion criteria to \[Search Results
Collection A\]:\
