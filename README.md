Dehnert (2020) highlights the importance of understanding how digital transformation dimensions are connected to firm performance, with contradictory findings in existing research. Affonso et al. (2020) emphasize the need for innovation in the oil and gas industry, pointing out the risk-averse approach of traditional project management as a hindrance to progress. Llopis-Albert et al. (2020) utilize fuzzy-set qualitative comparative analysis to analyze the impact of digital transformation on business performance models in the automotive industry. In the context of the banking sector, Naimi-Sadigh et al. (2021) discuss the implementation of digital transformation to respond to disruptions and drive innovation in banking services. Manjula et al. (2021) focus on digital technologies in the food retail industry, identifying challenges and opportunities in the digital transformation process. Imran et al. (2021) explore digital transformation in industrial organizations, aiming to identify key enablers and performance outcomes through data collected from leading industrial organizations. Furthermore, Kumar et al. (2022) propose a framework for assessing the social acceptability of Industry 4.0 technologies in digital manufacturing, highlighting the importance of considering social dimensions in technological advancements. Ren et al. (2023) shed light on the impact of digital transformation on renewable energy companies' performance in China, emphasizing the role of digital transformation in advancing the development of renewable energy enterprises. Zhao et al. (2023) analyze the relationship between digital transformation strategy and ESG performance in large manufacturing enterprises, focusing on the mediating role of green innovation and sustainable development goals. Overall, the literature review indicates a growing interest in understanding the impact of digital transformation on performance across various industries, highlighting both challenges and opportunities that come with embracing digital technologies (Sartal et al., 2020). The need for innovation, strategic alignment, and the identification of key enablers in the digital transformation process are recurring themes in the literature, emphasizing the importance of leveraging digital technologies to drive organizational success.
